This project is an EPUB reader based on MarkLogic Server V4.2. You can
try it out with the free, Community Edition of MarkLogic Server if you
don't already have the server running.

It supports (and only supports) EPUB V2 books that are not burdened
with Digital Rights Management encryption. I plan to upgrade it to
support EPUB V3 as the spec matures and time allows. I have no
interest in supporting DRM-encrusted content.

Because this implementation simply uses the web browser to display
EPUB content, it does not attempt to enforce the markup restrictions
of EPUB. You can, for example, use video or scripting.

The INSTALL file outlines how to setup and install the code.

The library page supports either list or bookshelf view. You can
filter the library by publisher, author, tag, or star rating. You can
specify your own tags and star ratings on the main page for each book.
There are several sorting options, and of course you can use full text
search.

If you have any questions or comments, please let me know.

Share and enjoy!
