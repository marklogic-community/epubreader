1. Install MarkLogic Server V4.2 (or later). This project requires
   XSLT support so will not run on earlier versions of the server. If
   you really want it on an earlier version of the server, you should
   be able to implement the two XSLT transformations in XQuery. But I
   haven't tried.

2. Grab a copy of this repository and put it somewhere that the
   MarkLogic server can see it. For the purposes of this document,
   I'll assume you put it in /projects/epubreader.

3. Create an EPUB database with appropriate forests.

4. Enable collection lexicons in the EPUB database.

5. Create two element range indexes, both of type string:

   Namespace  : http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
   Local names: identifier,title,publisher,subject,date,creator

   Namespace  : http://marklogic.com/ns/meta
   Local names: rating,tag

6. Create an application server for the EPUB database with the
   following settings:

   root:          /projects/epubreader
   uri rewriter:  /modules/rewriter.xqy

Now if you point your web browser at the machine and port that you
specified for the application server, you should see the empty library
page.

There are two ways to load EPUB files into the system:

1. Navigate to /upload.xqy and complete the the form.

2. Post (as in HTTP POST) the EPUB file to /load.xqy
